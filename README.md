# Phase 5 Project Trader Joe's Product Review

Me and my friends love Trader Joe's and we are sometimes obsessed with their items, we constantly send each other our critiques on new items and inform each other of new must try's. So to make this more simpler and convienent, I created a product review app where we can add new products that we have tried and read each others reviews on them.
